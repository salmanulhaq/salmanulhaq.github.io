{"name":"Resume | Salman Ul Haq","tagline":"","body":"## Status\r\nFounder & Chief Hacker @ TunaCode, the makers of *[CUVI](http://www.cuvilib.com)* and *[gKrypt](http://www.gkrypt.com)* and a bunch of cool side-projects.\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n\r\n### Founder & Chief Hacker, TunaCode Inc. 2010 -\r\nFounded TunaCode, a GPU computing startup with a focus on Computer Vision and Data Security. Built a small but kick-a** team of engineers who would help solve tough problems in Computer Vision, Data Security and Compression, helping R&D teams, startups and some blue-chip companies build new Vision functionality or port existing to GPUs.\r\n\r\nHeadline projects and achievements include:\r\n\r\n*    Helped conceive (idea!), build (code), productify (commercial SDK), market [CUVI](http://www.cuvilib.com). Starting from just 5 simple functions and no users to well over hundred functions and thousands of users. Have been repeating the process with growing user base and community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
